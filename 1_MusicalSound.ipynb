    "Just as a movie is a sequence of still photos (frames) displayed quickly to create the illusion of motion, digital audio is a series of \"snapshots\" (samples) of a sound wave. The **Sample Rate** is simply the count of these snapshots taken in one second, measured in **Hertz (Hz)** (which is itself cycles per second).\n",

    "[Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem) says that to digitally capture a specific frequency, you must capture at least two samples per cycle of that wave. This defines the **Nyquist Frequency** ($f_{Nyquist} = f_s / 2$) as the highest pitch you can record for a given sample rate ($f_s$). Since human hearing ranges up to ~20,000 Hz, we need a sample rate of at least 40,000 Hz to capture everything we can hear.\n",

    "**44.1 kHz** is the standard for CDs and consumer music. It was chosen to be slightly above the 40 kHz requirement to allow for a safety margin for audio filters. **48 kHz** is the standard for video, while higher rates like **96 kHz** are used in professional studios for processing flexibility."
