    "- $y$: Displacement (e.g., Air Pressure)\n",
    "- $t$: Time\n",

    "[add something above about how sound waves add up.  this would be related to whether noise is musical or not.. i suppose its when the final wave is the result of lots of waves crashing into each other, but i'd like to describe it in a way that's formally correct]\n",
