# Music Coding Project Rules

## Code Style

### No Magic Numbers
- Extract all literal numbers to named constants
- Constants should have descriptive names explaining their purpose
- Place constants at the top of the file/cell in a dedicated section
- Exception: 0, 1, -1 when used for indexing or simple increments

### Examples
```python
# Bad
return 69 + 12 * math.log2(freq / 440)

# Good
A4_FREQUENCY_HZ = 440
A4_MIDI_NUMBER = 69
NOTES_PER_OCTAVE = 12
return A4_MIDI_NUMBER + NOTES_PER_OCTAVE * math.log2(freq / A4_FREQUENCY_HZ)
```

## Code Organization

### Top-Down Structure
- Main/high-level functions first
- Helper functions below
- Constants at the top

### Function Design
- Each function does one thing
- Extract loop bodies into helper functions when logic is non-trivial
- Use descriptive function names that explain what they do
